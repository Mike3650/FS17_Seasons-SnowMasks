## Uploading

There are multiple ways to upload your snowmask here: you can use a Pull Request
that does all the work. If you don't know how that works, you can also make an
issue with the files attached. Or you can send it to us on
[Slack](http://realismus.joskuijpers.nl).

## License

For legal reasons for the creators, users and the Realismus Modding team, it is
important to have the work licensed. We suggest you release your snowmask under
the CC BY-SA 4.0 license. You can find it here on the Create Commons website,
[here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). It basically says
everybody can use it, share it and change it to their liking. However, there
must always be attribution (the name of the original creator) and if someone
makes changes, those must be disclosed (written down). If you make changes
you also have to make it available to others under CC BY-SA 4.0.

If you want your snowmask removed or are having issues regarding licensing, you
can contact us directly on [Slack](http://realismus.joskuijpers.nl).
