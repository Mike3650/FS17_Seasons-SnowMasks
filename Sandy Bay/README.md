# Sandy Bay snow mask

Created by Stoatie

These are the files you need to add to your map01 folder of SandyBay17pc to have a basic snow mask without having to use Giants Editor.
All buildings that you can enter and the train tracks are masked. (I think)
You still need to follow the Info for map makers instructions for adding the foliage to your map through Notepad++

The roads are currently missing.
